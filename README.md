# Convolution-Neural-Networks-CNN

#### Problem Statement: -

1.	Build a CNN model on CIFAR-10 dataset by applying few regularization techniques like drop out and data augmentation
2.	Find out the differences between Convnet filter and the Maxpool layers

3.	If the input of an image is 64x64x3 which has been convolved by 10 5x5 filters with stride 1 and padding 2:

a.	How many activation maps are obtained?

b.	What is the size of the activation maps?

c.	How many parameters are calculated?

4.	What are the different techniques that need to be applied to overcome the issue of overfitting? Provide brief explanations of how these techniques address the issue.
